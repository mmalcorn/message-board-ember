Question and Answer Message Board
Create a question and answer message board where a user submits a question and other users can respond with answers.

<!-- Questions should have the content of the question itself, an author and additional notes. -->
Answers should have the content of the answer and the author.
Include a header and/or navbar that appears on all pages containing the name of your site and a link to the home page.
<!-- List all questions on the homepage, with only the question and the name of the author showing. -->
Users should be able to click on a question to view additional information.
<!-- Allow users to add and edit questions. -->
Allow users to add answers to a question. Answers should be added and viewed on the same page as the question they respond to.
